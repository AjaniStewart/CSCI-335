# Compiling

# Changes 
    - I mentionened it before in the files, but if I treated a file as an interface, I removed
    its constructors because interfaces should not have have constructors

## HashTable class Changes
    - find now returned either -1 (if not found) or the position of the item
        - I made this change because I believed it was the easiest way to get the postion of the item
        in the array of parent trees
    - parameters of find, insert, and remove are marked as const reference to minimize copying
    - an r-value insert has been added for temporary object insertion (works the same as regular insert)
    - an public empty() function was added to check for emptiness (it was for my testing)

# Other modifications
    - const methods removed from SubwaySystem as in piazza it was mentioned that they give errors
